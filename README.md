## How to run locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want the project to be stored.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository_url>` with the GitHub repository URL.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change to the project folder:
     ```
     cd <project_folder>
     ```
   - Replace `<project_folder>` with the repository folder's name.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install project dependencies with:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the App**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Explore and Make Changes**:
   - Interact with the app in the browser.
   - Edit the code in your text editor; the browser will update automatically.

7. **Stop the Development Server**:
   - To stop the server, return to the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.

8. **Deploy to Production (Optional)**:
   - For online hosting, follow deployment instructions for platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

Note: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. The `npm start` command may not open the browser on all systems; manually go to `http://localhost:3000`.
